You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
  * I think that I did not acquire new skill until now.
  * Developing the mocking project was easy since there was specific hints within the project description. And since the design of the page is already generated, mocking projects 
	are nice and easy to finish. Since using simple html tags, it seems easy to me to figure out and finish quiz and projects.
  * It was hard to select and start to be a web developer since I need to make a mind set and need to convince myself to continue steadfastly. 
  * I have used searching the web to find solutions for project specific questions. Also, it is nice to know that I'm at the beginning of web development and try to
	keep my eager at high.
